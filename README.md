The Game of Life is an imaginary robot game (cellular automaton) made by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

## Rules
1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.

2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Try this:
You (God) can add and remove cells while the universe is emulating allowing you to directly change the cells in real time.
Drawing a Gosper glider gun, the universe wraps around so you can see some pretty cool gliders flying around!
